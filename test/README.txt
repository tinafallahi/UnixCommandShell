Coursework 1 - Unix Command Shell in C
This program compiles with a simple: gcc bash.c
The profile.txt file holds the HOME and PATH variables and they should be adjusted to the 
machine that this program will be run on, otherwise there will be errors about incorrect
variables. 
This shell only implements the existing binaries, cd (without spaces in the file name) and $PATH="…"/$HOME="…" commands.
